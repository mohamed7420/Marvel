## Introduction

## Reactive Programming with RxSwift and RxDataSource

Marvel Repo utilizes the power of reactive programming through RxSwift and takes advantage of the streamlined data binding provided by RxDataSource. This combination enables a more responsive and scalable architecture for handling asynchronous events and managing data-driven updates.

### Why RxSwift?

[RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) is a powerful reactive programming library for Swift. It allows for the easy composition of asynchronous and event-driven code, making it particularly well-suited for handling user interfaces. In Marvel, RxSwift is employed to create a reactive and responsive user interface, simplifying the handling of complex UI interactions and asynchronous data flows.

### RxDataSource for UICollectionView

[**RxDataSource**](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxDataSource) is an extension of RxSwift designed specifically for UITableView and UICollectionView. In the case of Marvel, RxDataSource is utilized with UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource to efficiently manage and update the content of the UICollectionView based on changes in the underlying data.

#### Key Benefits:

- **Reactive Data Binding**: RxDataSource simplifies the process of binding data to UICollectionView, allowing for automatic updates when the underlying data changes.
  
- **Diffable Data Source**: Marvel employs UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource to achieve efficient and animated updates when the data changes, enhancing the user experience.
